\section{Displaying code in \LaTeX}

By using the following LaTeX code, you can directly source code from a file containing the code, i.e. from a Perl script.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=TeX,caption=Showing code from a file]
\lstinputlisting[language=Perl]{random_word.pl}
\end{lstlisting}

\lstinputlisting[language=Perl]{random_word.pl}

\noindent
Code can be directly entered into the LaTeX document as well.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R,caption=Installing the R randomForest package]
# install the randomForest package
install.packages("randomForest")

# load the randomForest library
library(randomForest)
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent
When breaklines=false, code will not be wrapped.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Perl,caption=Code without wrapping]
#!/usr/bin/env perl

use strict;
use warnings;

print "This is a really really really really really really really really really really really really pointless sentence!\n";

exit(0);
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent
If breaklines=true, then the code will be wrapped.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Perl,caption=Code with wrapping,breaklines=true]
#!/usr/bin/env perl

use strict;
use warnings;

print "This is a really really really really really really really really really really really really pointless sentence!\n";

exit(0);
\end{lstlisting}
